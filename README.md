I am a big fan of Domain Driven Design, Design patterns (both GOF and PoEAA) and Principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY), and ASP.Net MVC. In my career I am not fortunate to have any mentor. Therefore, I always read technical books to enrich my technical knowledge. Among all those books, one book has a huge influence in this project which is “Professional ASP.Net Design Pattern” of Scott Millett. This project is inspired by the project of Scott Millett “Agatha’s Storefront”. This project is differed in use of ORM. I used Code First Entity Framework ORM whereas Agathas used NHibernet. I have written some blogs by inspiring his famous books “Professional ASP.Net Design Patterns” and “Practicing Domain Driven Design”. I prefer to write down my notes in my blogs to remember and share with others.I would like to give special thanks to brother, Ashraf Alam Joy. He is my big inspiration. As well as, I would like to give special thanks to Md. Ariful Hoque, Kaiser Ahmed, Rashedul Islam, Rabbiul Islam, Kuntal Biswas, Shuvo Sarkar for supporting me mentally to continue this project. If this project and my written blogs would help anyone in any ways then it would be a great achievement for me.
